## Usage

### Authentication

Users can register for a new account or log in with their existing credentials. Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.

### Posts

Users can create new posts, edit their existing posts, and delete posts they no longer want to share. They can also like and comment on posts to engage with other users.

### Interactions

Engage with posts through likes and comments. See how many likes a post has and read through the comments to join the conversation.

### Friend Requests

Search for users and send friend requests to connect. Accept incoming friend requests to build your network.

### Chat Module

Real-time chat functionality allows users to send messages to their friends. This feature is designed to mimic the experience of using WhatsApp.

## Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database schema is designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. Key tables include:
- `Users`: Stores user information.
- `Posts`: Stores posts created by users.
- `Comments`: Stores comments on posts.
- `Friends`: Manages friend relationships between users.
- `Messages`: Stores chat messages.

## Security

- **Authentication**: Implemented using JWT tokens to ensure secure access.
- **Authorization**: Middleware functions ensure users can only access their own data.
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data like passwords are encrypted using industry-standard hashing algorithms.
